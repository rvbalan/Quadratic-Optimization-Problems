Quadratic Optimization Problems using Graph Deep Learning

Source Code: 
For small n (n<=10) run 'qap_driver.m'
For large n run 'qap_largen.m'
Local folders with GCN parameters: 2_layers_noBias , 2_layers_withBias , 3_layers_noBias , 3_layers_withBias

For n<=10, raw data in 'TestBed' folder
Results in 'results' folder
